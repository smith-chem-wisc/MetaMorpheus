MetaMorpheus is a bottom-up proteomics database search software with integrated post-translational modification (PTM) discovery capability.
This program combines features of [Morpheus](https://github.com/cwenger/Morpheus) and [G-PTM-D](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/gptmd) in a single tool.

Check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/wiki) for software details!

## Major Features

* Database Search: A robust search algorithm that identifies peptides by their fragmentation spectra. Watch our <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16841846/40379523-eb130166-5dbb-11e8-8a03-559599cdd560.png">[Search task YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUM12UBJNuA)
* Calibration: A calibration tool that uses peptides identified by a database search to calibrate the m/z values of all peaks in the spectra. This improves the quality of any subsequent search or analysis of the data. Watch our <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16841846/40379523-eb130166-5dbb-11e8-8a03-559599cdd560.png">[calibration task YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LfiOqqqj8Q).
* G-PTM-D: Post-translational modification (PTM) discovery, which expands the scope of peptide identifications to include both known and unknown PTMs. Watch our <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16841846/40379523-eb130166-5dbb-11e8-8a03-559599cdd560.png">[GPTMD task YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXGT4XExLBo).
* [Quantification](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/wiki/Quantification): Ultrafast label-free peptide quantification with FlashLFQ. MS2-identified peptides are used as "seeds" for peakfinding, including PTM-containing peptides. Watch our <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16841846/40379523-eb130166-5dbb-11e8-8a03-559599cdd560.png">[Label-free quantification with MetaMorpheus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgXRuExtuRI) video on YouTube.
* [O-glycopeptide Characterization](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/wiki/1_New-Task:-O-Glyco-Search): O-Pair Search identifies O-glycopeptides using an ion-indexed open modification search and localizes O-glycosites using graph theory and probability-based localization.

## Test Installation (Windows GUI)

1. Download the latest MetaMorpheusInstaller.msi [release](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/releases), and install MetaMorpheus.
2. Download the example spectra and database files from [https://uwmadison.box.com/v/MetaMorpheusPublic](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/2u42qp0b8jllywqzeungmjj04gplw5in).
3. Open MetaMorpheus from the start menu, and drag and drop the .raw spectra files and the UniProt .xml database into MetaMorpheus.
4. Add a series of Tasks to make a workflow for MetaMorpheus to follow. Drag the .toml files (these files store MetaMorpheus's search parameters) (Task1 - Task5) into the application.
  * Task1-SearchTaskconfig.toml - the standard search functionality.
  * Task2-CalibrateTaskconfig.toml - will mass-calibrate the spectra file based on high scoring search results and write a new calibrated .mzML file.
  * Task3-SearchTaskconfig.toml - searches the newly calibrated data file, which demonstrates improved performance (more PSMs, lower mass errors) and allows for tighter search tolerances.
  * Task4-GPTMDTaskconfig.toml - searches the calibrated data file to find high-probability PTMs. This search task generates a new .xml protein database with annotated PTM possibilities discovered by G-PTM-D.
  * Task5-SearchTaskconfig.toml - searches the calibrated input file against the G-PTM-D .xml database. This search result is the highest confidence in terms of total PSMs and modified peptides.
5. Click "Run All Tasks!"
6. As the third task completes, open the results.txt files for the first and third tasks (before and after calibration, respectively). Observe the increase in the number of confident PSMs and identified peptides due to calibration.
7. As the fifth task completes, open the results.txt files for the third and fifth tasks. Observe the increase in the number of confident PSMs identified due to discovered PTM-containing peptides.

## Typical Usage (Windows GUI)
1. Open MetaMorpheus from the start menu, and drag and drop your .raw spectra files and protein database into the GUI.
2. Select "New Calibrate Task" tab and enter appropriate search parameters, using slightly liberal mass tolerances. Then "Add the Calibration Task". Subsequent tasks (searches) will use suggested ppm tolerances automatically generated by the calibration task.
3. Select "New GPTMD Task" tab. Specify the G-PTM-D modifications that you think may be present in your sample. Many typical modifications are pre-selected. Then "Add the GPTMD Task".
4. Select "New Search Task" tab. Specify the Post-Search Parameters (e.g. protein parsimony, quantification). Then "Add the Search Task".
5. Select "Run all tasks!". This search automatically looks for PTMs uncovered in the G-PTM-D step.

## Test Installation (Windows Command Line Executable)

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/releases). Extract "MetaMorpheus_CommandLine.zip" using, for example, [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).
2. Download the example spectra and database files at [https://uwmadison.box.com/v/MetaMorpheusPublic](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/2u42qp0b8jllywqzeungmjj04gplw5in) to the folder with the CMD.exe executable.
3. Run the command:

```
CMD.exe -t Task1-SearchTaskconfig.toml Task2-CalibrateTaskconfig.toml Task3-SearchTaskconfig.toml Task4-GPTMDTaskconfig.toml Task5-SearchTaskconfig.toml -s 04-30-13_CAST_Frac4_6uL.raw 04-30-13_CAST_Frac5_4uL.raw -d uniprot-mouse-reviewed-1-24-2018.xml.gz uniprot-cRAP-1-24-2018.xml.gz
```
4. As the third task completes, open the results.txt files for the first and third tasks (before and after calibration). Observe the increase in the number of confident PSMs identified due to calibration.
5. As the fifth task completes, open the results.txt files for the third and fifth tasks. Observe the increase in the number of confident PSMs identified due to an addition of new plausible PTMs.

## mzLib


[mzLib](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/mzLib) is a [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/mzLib/) package that we created as an all-purpose toolchest for mass-spec data analysis and many of its functions provide the tools for MetaMorpheus. mzLib is freely available for use in mass-spec applications. You do not need to download mzLib separately to run MetaMorpheus; it is already included.
